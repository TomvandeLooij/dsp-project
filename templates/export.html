            <h3>Explanation of scoring metrics</h3>
            <p>
                When a building is on fire, there can be multiple infrastructural entities in jeopardy, like buildings, roads and 
                public transport. To quantify the risk of harming surrounding entities, a score has been calculated for every function of a building, type of public transport and every type of road.
                The scores that the different type of entities hold is given in the tables below.
                So to calculate the score, the amount of times a certain entity occurs is multiplied with the corresponding weight. This
                is done for all entities in the radius and summed up. These values have been normalised, resulting in a risk factor, which is the visible score in the prototype.
